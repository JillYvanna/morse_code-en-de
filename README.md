Assignment for 1st Year module: Introductory Programming and Problem Solving. Morse code encoder and encoder using python

###Morse Code Encoder and Decoder###

A coding assignment for my university module that assessed our
knowledge of Python data structures and iteration. 
We were tasked with implementing a range of features that had to 
conclude to the expected result given in the project brief.
Other than the given functions, data, and main function all code 
within the functions are written by myself.

Descriptions and comments of how each function works are written within
the code, alongside other features.

The purpose of the code is to be able to encode a given sentence / word 
into the IDE programme into morse code and vice versa. A challenge task was to then 
encode or decode a file given to the programme and output it into the same folder
where the program is saved to under "result.txt".

As of right now it is only a code file that can be saved as a python file and ran on
a terminal. 
However, I have had fun trying to use it for other means of experimentation such as 
password creation albeit weak but with the way it's coded the morse code could
be replaced for other letters or words to create your own language/cyphers.
